##The @pytest.mark.timeout(seconds) marker from the pytest-timeout plugin sets the maximum allowable execution time for the test function. In this example, the first test should pass because it completes within the 5-second limit, while the second test should fail because it deliberately takes 2 seconds, exceeding the 1-second limit.
##The time.sleep() calls are placeholders for the logic you want to test. Replace them with the functions or code segments you need to time-constrain.
##Before running the tests, ensure to install the pytest-timeout plugin first:
